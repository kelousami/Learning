Data structures are ways of organizing data in computer science.

Data structures are implementation of abstract data types

Basic data structures include :

Arrays
    a number of elements in a specific order.
    typically same type.
    access to elements is done via index.
    may be fixed-lenght or resizable.
    advantage is random-access.
    insert and retrieve are slow as they require relocation of other elements.
    
Linked lists
    linear collection of elements (called nodes) of any type.
    any node has a value and a pointer to the next node.
    insertion and removal are advantages. 
    random-access slower as it requires traversing list seeking for the element
    to be accessed.

Records
    a value containing other values, called fields or members

Classes
    contains records and methods that apply to those records
